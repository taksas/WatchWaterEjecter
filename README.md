# Watch Water Ejecter
Provide smartwatches with more options for draining sound from the speaker.

## Description
Watch Water Ejecter is a drainage app for devices running Wear OS.
Developed with the goal of "providing an advantage over any standard drainer or existing drainer app," the app provides drainer functionality for devices such as the Pixel Watch that do not come standard with drainer functionality, and more options for devices that do come standard with drainer functionality.

It has the following features
- Change of operation sound patterns
Depending on the speaker shape, mesh, and distance to the frame, the appropriate operating frequency will vary. Provides more options for operating frequency and operating pulse.

- Change the operating volume
Maximum volume is not always the right volume. If you are having trouble with deafeningly loud volume, you should try this app.

- Change Operation Duration
Maybe you need 15 seconds of drainage for pesky water, or conversely, maybe 1 second is fine. Either way, being able to customize is a good thing.

- Vibration intensity change during operation
This will inhibit water from staying in the frame around the speaker. Of course, for those of you who think this is useless, there is an option to turn off the feature.



And for added convenience.
- Complications
One tap to drain from the dial. No need to even bring up the menu.

- Tiles
A smart second option for those who don't have space on their dial. Simply slide it to the side and tap to drain.
